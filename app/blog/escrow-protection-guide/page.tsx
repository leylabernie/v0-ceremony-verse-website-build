              When spending thousands on wedding items from distant suppliers, escrow protection isn't just nice to
              haveâ€”it's essential. Here's everything you need to know about protecting your investment.

                  <p className="text-sm text-foreground/70 mb-0">
                    The average Indian-American fusion wedding costs $225,000-$300,000, with significant portions spent
                    on items sourced from India. Without proper payment protection, you're risking tens of thousands of
                    dollars on suppliers you've never met in person.

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">What Is Escrow Protection?</h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Escrow is a financial arrangement where a third party holds and regulates payment of funds required for
              two parties involved in a transaction. Think of it as a neutral referee that ensures both buyer and seller
              fulfill their obligations before money changes hands.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              For wedding purchases, here's how it works: You pay for your items (lehenga, jewelry, decor), but instead
              of the money going directly to the supplier, it's held securely by the escrow service. The supplier ships
              your items. Once you receive and approve them, the escrow service releases payment to the supplier. If
              there's a problem, you have recourse.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">
              Why Traditional Payment Methods Fall Short
            </h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Many couples make the mistake of using standard payment methods for high-value wedding purchases:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-foreground/80 space-y-3">
              <li>
                <strong>Wire Transfers:</strong> Once sent, the money is gone. If the supplier doesn't deliver or sends
                inferior products, you have virtually no recourse. Wire transfer fraud is common in cross-border
                transactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Credit Cards:</strong> While they offer some protection, chargebacks for international
                transactions are complex, time-consuming, and often unsuccessful. Plus, many Indian suppliers don't
                accept credit cards or charge high processing fees.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>PayPal Friends & Family:</strong> Offers zero buyer protection. Suppliers often request this to
                avoid fees, but it leaves you completely vulnerable.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cryptocurrency:</strong> Transactions are irreversible and offer no buyer protection whatsoever.
              </li>
            </ul>

                    The supplier creates your items and ships them with tracking information. You receive updates
                    throughout the process. For custom items, milestone-based releases can be arranged (30% to start,
                    40% at progress check, 30% upon delivery approval).

                    the situation fairly.

            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Not all escrow services are created equal. When evaluating protection for your wedding purchases, ensure
              the service offers:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-foreground/80 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>International Transaction Experience:</strong> Cross-border payments have unique challenges.
                Choose services familiar with India-US/Mexico transactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Clear Dispute Resolution Process:</strong> Understand exactly how disputes are handled, typical
                resolution timeframes (7-10 business days is standard), and what evidence is required.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Milestone Payment Options:</strong> For custom items over $5,000, staged payments provide
                additional security and quality checkpoints.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasonable Fees:</strong> Escrow fees typically range from 2-5% of transaction value. This is a
                small price for protecting five-figure purchases.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Supplier Verification:</strong> The best services vet suppliers before allowing them on the

              Questions to Ask Before Any Large Purchase
            </h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Before committing to any wedding supplier, especially for items over $1,000, ask these critical questions:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 text-foreground/80 space-y-3">
              <li>
                <strong>Do you offer escrow payment protection?</strong> If the answer is no, ask why. Legitimate
                suppliers understand buyer concerns and should be willing to work with escrow services.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>What is your refund and return policy?</strong> Get this in writing. Vague promises aren't
                enforceable.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Can you provide references from US/Mexico customers?</strong> Speak with previous clients about
                their experience, especially regarding delivery and quality.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>What quality guarantees do you offer?</strong> Understand exactly what recourse you have if
                items don't meet specifications.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>How do you handle disputes?</strong> A supplier's willingness to discuss this openly is a good
                sign of their integrity.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Your wedding is one of the most significant financial investments you'll make. When sourcing items from
              distant suppliersâ€”especially across international bordersâ€”escrow protection isn't optional; it's
              essential.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The small fee for escrow services (typically 2-5% of purchase price) is insignificant compared to the risk
              of losing thousands of dollars to fraud, non-delivery, or quality issues. More importantly, escrow
              protection gives you peace of mind during an already stressful planning process.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Remember:</strong> Any supplier who refuses to work with escrow protection or pressures you to use
              unprotected payment methods is a red flag. Legitimate businesses understand buyer concerns and welcome
              systems that protect both parties.
