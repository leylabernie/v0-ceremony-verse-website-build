            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Indian-American fusion weddings are more than just combining two cultures—they're about creating a
              meaningful celebration that reflects your unique journey. Whether you're reconnecting with your heritage
              or introducing your partner's family to Indian traditions, these ten elements will help you create an
              authentic, memorable experience.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">
              1. The Sacred Mandap: Your Ceremonial Centerpiece
            </h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The mandap is the heart of any Indian wedding ceremony. This ornate canopy represents the universe where
              the couple will begin their married life. For fusion weddings, consider a mandap that blends traditional
              elements with your venue's aesthetic.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Work with verified suppliers who understand both traditional requirements and
              modern design sensibilities. Your mandap should feature the four pillars representing the four parents,
              but can incorporate flowers, fabrics, and colors that complement your overall wedding theme.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">
              2. Mehendi Ceremony: Art, Tradition, and Celebration
            </h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The Mehendi ceremony is often the first major pre-wedding event, where intricate henna designs are applied
              to the bride's hands and feet. This intimate gathering has evolved into a vibrant celebration that both
              cultures can enjoy.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Modern fusion approach: Host a Mehendi party with professional henna artists for all guests who want to
              participate. Pair traditional Indian music with contemporary playlists, and serve fusion appetizers that
              introduce non-Indian guests to authentic flavors. This creates an inclusive atmosphere while maintaining
              cultural authenticity.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">
              3. Sangeet Night: Music, Dance, and Family Bonding
            </h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The Sangeet is perhaps the most adaptable Indian tradition for fusion weddings. This musical evening
              brings both families together through performances, dancing, and celebration.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Create a program that includes traditional Indian performances, Bollywood dance numbers, and Western songs
              that are meaningful to your relationship. Many couples choreograph group dances that involve family
              members from both sides, creating lasting memories and breaking down cultural barriers through shared joy.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">
              4. The Baraat: A Grand Entrance with Cultural Flair
            </h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The groom's processional, or Baraat, is one of the most visually stunning Indian wedding traditions.
              Traditionally, the groom arrives on a decorated horse accompanied by dancing family and friends.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              For fusion weddings, consider creative alternatives: vintage cars, decorated golf carts, or even arriving
              by boat if your venue permits. The key is maintaining the celebratory energy with dhol drummers and
              dancing guests, regardless of the mode of transportation. This spectacle delights guests from all
              backgrounds and sets an energetic tone for the celebration.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">
              5. Sacred Fire and Seven Steps: The Saptapadi
            </h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The Saptapadi, or seven steps around the sacred fire, is the most important ritual in a Hindu wedding
              ceremony. Each step represents a vow the couple makes to each other.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              For guests unfamiliar with this tradition, provide a printed program explaining each step's significance.
              Consider having a bilingual officiant who can explain the rituals in both Hindi and English, making the
              ceremony accessible to all attendees while maintaining its spiritual depth. This educational approach
              helps everyone appreciate the profound meaning behind each ritual.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">
              6. Fusion Attire: Honoring Both Traditions
            </h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Wedding attire is where many couples beautifully blend their cultures. The bride might wear a traditional
              red or pink lehenga for the Indian ceremony and change into a white gown for the reception, or create a
              custom fusion outfit that incorporates elements of both.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Shopping Tip:</strong> When sourcing authentic Indian wedding attire, work with verified suppliers
              who offer virtual shopping consultations. This allows you to see fabrics, embroidery, and craftsmanship in
              real-time through video calls, ensuring quality without traveling to India. Look for suppliers who offer
              escrow payment protection for high-value purchases.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">
              7. Culinary Fusion: A Feast for All Palates
            </h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Food is central to Indian celebrations, and fusion weddings offer exciting opportunities to showcase both
              cuisines. The key is creating a menu that respects dietary restrictions while introducing guests to
              authentic flavors.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Consider a multi-station approach: traditional Indian dishes (with clear labels for vegetarian, vegan, and
              spice levels), familiar American options, and creative fusion items that blend both cuisines. Include
              Indian sweets like gulab jamun and jalebi alongside traditional wedding cake. Offer signature cocktails
              that incorporate Indian flavors like cardamom, saffron, or mango.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">
              8. Personalized Welcome Bags: Cultural Introduction
            </h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Welcome bags are an excellent way to introduce guests to Indian wedding traditions while showing
              appreciation for their presence. These thoughtful gifts set the tone for your celebration.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Include items like: a detailed itinerary explaining each ceremony, comfortable footwear for dancing,
              traditional Indian snacks, a small bottle of rose water, and a guide to Indian wedding customs. For
              multi-day celebrations, consider adding hangover kits, local treats, and a personalized note thanking
              guests for traveling to celebrate with you.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">
              9. Entertainment That Bridges Cultures
            </h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Entertainment at fusion weddings should engage guests from all backgrounds. The best approach combines
              traditional elements with universal appeal.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Hire a DJ experienced with both Bollywood and Western music who can read the room and create seamless
              transitions. Consider live performances like classical Indian dancers or musicians during cocktail hour,
              followed by high-energy dancing later. Interactive elements like 360-degree photo booths with
              Indian-themed props, mehndi stations, or sari-draping demonstrations keep guests engaged throughout the
              celebration.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">
              10. The Vidaai: An Emotional Farewell
            </h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The Vidaai is the emotional ceremony where the bride leaves her parents' home to start her new life. This
              tradition, while bittersweet, is deeply meaningful and resonates across cultures.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              In fusion weddings, this ceremony can be adapted to honor both families. The bride tosses rice over her
              shoulder (symbolizing prosperity for her parents' home) while her family showers the couple with flower
              petals. This moment of transition, though rooted in Indian tradition, speaks to the universal experience
              of families coming together and children beginning their own journeys.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">Making It All Come Together</h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Creating an authentic fusion wedding requires careful planning, cultural sensitivity, and the right
              partners. The most successful celebrations are those where every element—from the mandap to the menu—tells
              your unique story.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Key Success Factors:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-foreground/80 space-y-2">
              <li>Work with verified suppliers who understand both traditional requirements and modern aesthetics</li>
              <li>Protect your investment with escrow payment systems for high-value items</li>
              <li>Communicate clearly with all vendors about your vision for cultural fusion</li>
              <li>Educate guests about traditions through programs, welcome bags, and bilingual ceremonies</li>
              <li>Stay true to what matters most to you—not every tradition needs to be included</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Remember, your fusion wedding should feel authentic to your relationship and respectful of both cultures.
              There's no single "right way" to blend traditions—the best approach is one that honors your heritage while
              celebrating your unique love story.
