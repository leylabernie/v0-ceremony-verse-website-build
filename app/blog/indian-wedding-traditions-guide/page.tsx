                <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl text-charcoal mb-4">Why Understanding Traditions Matters</h2>
                <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  If you're planning an Indian-American fusion wedding, you might feel caught between two worlds.
                  Perhaps you grew up in the United States, celebrated American holidays, but your parents still speak
                  about the "proper way" to have a wedding. You want to honor your heritage, but you're not entirely
                  sure what each tradition means or why it matters.
                </p>
                <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">
                  You're not alone. Many second-generation Indian-Americans feel disconnected from their cultural roots
                  while simultaneously wanting to celebrate them. This guide will walk you through the most important
                  Indian wedding traditions, explain their significance, and show you how to incorporate them
                  authentically into your modern fusion wedding.
                </p>

              {/* Pre-Wedding Ceremonies */}
              <h2 className="font-serif text-4xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-12">Pre-Wedding Ceremonies</h2>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl text-primary mb-4">1. Roka Ceremony</h3>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>What it is:</strong> The Roka is the official announcement that the couple is engaged. It's an
                intimate gathering where both families meet, exchange gifts, and give their blessings.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>The significance:</strong> This ceremony marks the formal acceptance of the bride and groom into
                each other's families. It's a promise that both families will support the union.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>Modern adaptation:</strong> Many couples combine the Roka with their engagement party, creating
                a fusion event that includes both traditional gift exchanges and Western engagement traditions like
                champagne toasts and speeches.
              </p>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl text-primary mb-4">2. Mehendi Ceremony (Henna Night)</h3>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>What it is:</strong> The Mehendi ceremony involves applying intricate henna designs to the
                bride's hands and feet. Female family members and friends also get henna applied while celebrating with
                music, dancing, and food.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>The significance:</strong> Henna is believed to bring good luck and prosperity. The darker the
                henna stain, the stronger the love between the couple (according to tradition). It's also said that the
                bride doesn't have to do housework until the henna fades!
              </p>
              <div className="bg-sage/10 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6 border border-sage/20">
                <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Book your Mehendi artist 6-8 months in advance, especially if you want
                  intricate bridal designs. A full bridal Mehendi can take 4-6 hours to apply.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>Modern adaptation:</strong> Turn your Mehendi into a garden party or spa day. Provide henna
                stations for guests, serve fusion appetizers, and create a playlist mixing Bollywood hits with your
                favorite Western songs.
              </p>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl text-primary mb-4">3. Haldi Ceremony (Turmeric Ritual)</h3>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>What it is:</strong> Family members apply a paste made of turmeric, sandalwood, and rose water
                to the bride and groom (in separate ceremonies). This happens 1-2 days before the wedding.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>The significance:</strong> Turmeric is known for its cleansing and beautifying properties. The
                ritual is meant to purify the couple before marriage and give them a natural glow. It's also believed to
                ward off evil spirits.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>Modern adaptation:</strong> Embrace the mess! Wear yellow outfits you don't mind ruining, set up
                a photo booth with yellow props, and prepare for a fun, playful ceremony. Many couples now do joint
                Haldi ceremonies instead of separate ones.
              </p>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl text-primary mb-4">4. Sangeet Night (Music & Dance Celebration)</h3>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>What it is:</strong> The Sangeet is a musical evening where both families come together to
                perform choreographed dances, sing songs, and celebrate. It's become one of the most anticipated events
                of Indian weddings.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>The significance:</strong> Originally, the Sangeet was for the bride's female relatives to sing
                traditional folk songs. Today, it's evolved into a full-scale performance night where both families
                compete in friendly dance battles.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-primary/5 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6 border border-primary/20">
                <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                  <strong>Budget Tip:</strong> The Sangeet can be one of your most cost-effective events. Rent a
                  community hall or host it in a large backyard. The entertainment is provided by your family and
                  friends!
                </p>
              </div>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>Modern adaptation:</strong> Mix Bollywood dance performances with Western songs. Include your
                non-Indian friends in the performances. Hire a DJ who can seamlessly blend both musical styles.
              </p>

              {/* Wedding Day Ceremonies */}
              <h2 className="font-serif text-4xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-12">Wedding Day Ceremonies</h2>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl text-primary mb-4">5. Baraat (Groom's Procession)</h3>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>What it is:</strong> The groom arrives at the wedding venue in a grand procession, traditionally
                on a decorated horse or elephant, accompanied by his family and friends dancing to dhol (drum) beats.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>The significance:</strong> The Baraat announces the groom's arrival and demonstrates the joy and
                celebration of the occasion. It's a show of the groom's family's happiness and pride.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>Modern adaptation:</strong> In the US, grooms often arrive in luxury cars, vintage cars, or even
                party buses. Some creative grooms have arrived on motorcycles, in helicopters, or leading a second-line
                parade (New Orleans style). The key is the energy and celebration, not the mode of transport.
              </p>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl text-primary mb-4">6. Milni (Meeting of Families)</h3>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>What it is:</strong> After the Baraat arrives, the bride's family formally welcomes the groom's
                family. Male relatives from both sides are paired up and exchange garlands and gifts.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>The significance:</strong> Milni symbolizes the union of two families, not just two individuals.
                It's a recognition that marriage creates bonds between entire families.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>Modern adaptation:</strong> Include female relatives in the Milni ceremony. Some couples create
                a receiving line where all immediate family members from both sides greet each other.
              </p>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl text-primary mb-4">7. Mandap Ceremony (The Main Wedding Ritual)</h3>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>What it is:</strong> The wedding ceremony takes place under a decorated canopy called a Mandap,
                which represents the universe. The ceremony includes several key rituals:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-charcoal/80 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Kanyadaan:</strong> The bride's parents give away their daughter
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Hasta Melap:</strong> The couple's hands are tied together with a sacred thread
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Saptapadi (Seven Steps):</strong> The couple takes seven steps around the sacred fire, making
                  seven vows
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Sindoor & Mangalsutra:</strong> The groom applies vermillion to the bride's hair parting and
                  ties a sacred necklace around her neck
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>The significance:</strong> Each ritual has deep spiritual meaning. The seven steps represent
                seven aspects of married life: nourishment, strength, prosperity, happiness, progeny, longevity, and
                harmony.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>Modern adaptation:</strong> Work with your officiant to explain each ritual in English for
                non-Indian guests. Some couples write their own vows to recite alongside the traditional Sanskrit
                mantras. You can also shorten the ceremony from 2-3 hours to 45-60 minutes by condensing certain
                rituals.
              </p>

              {/* Post-Wedding Traditions */}
              <h2 className="font-serif text-4xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-12">Post-Wedding Traditions</h2>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl text-primary mb-4">8. Vidaai (Bride's Farewell)</h3>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>What it is:</strong> The bride says goodbye to her family and leaves with the groom. She
                traditionally throws rice over her shoulder toward her parents' home.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>The significance:</strong> The rice throwing symbolizes that the bride is repaying her parents
                for all they've given her. It's an emotional moment acknowledging that she's leaving her childhood home
                to start a new life.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>Modern adaptation:</strong> Since many couples already live together before marriage, the Vidaai
                can feel less relevant. Some couples do a symbolic Vidaai at the end of the reception, while others skip
                it entirely or replace it with a thank-you speech to both sets of parents.
              </p>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl text-primary mb-4">9. Griha Pravesh (Welcome to New Home)</h3>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>What it is:</strong> The bride is welcomed into the groom's family home. She kicks a pot of rice
                at the entrance, symbolizing bringing prosperity to the household.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>The significance:</strong> This ritual marks the bride's official entry into her new family and
                home.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>Modern adaptation:</strong> If the couple has their own home, they can perform this ritual
                together at their own place. Some couples do a small ceremony when they return from their honeymoon.
              </p>

              <h2 className="font-serif text-4xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-12">Regional Variations to Know</h2>

              <h2 className="font-serif text-4xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-12">Navigating Family Expectations</h2>
              <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                One of the biggest challenges in planning a fusion wedding is balancing your vision with family
                expectations. Here's how to handle common situations:
              </p>

              <div className="bg-primary/5 rounded-xl p-8 mb-8 border border-primary/20">
                <h4 className="font-serif text-xl text-charcoal mb-4">When Parents Want All the Traditions:</h4>
                <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  <strong>Strategy:</strong> Prioritize the "non-negotiables" for your parents. Ask them to choose their
                  top 3-5 must-have traditions. Explain that you want to honor these traditions meaningfully rather than
                  rushing through everything.
                </p>
                <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Compromise:</strong> Offer to do certain rituals in a more intimate setting (like Haldi with
                  just close family) rather than skipping them entirely.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-primary/5 rounded-xl p-8 mb-8 border border-primary/20">
                <h4 className="font-serif text-xl text-charcoal mb-4">When You Don't Understand the Traditions:</h4>
                <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  <strong>Strategy:</strong> Have your parents or grandparents explain the significance of each
                  tradition. Understanding the "why" often makes you more excited to include it.
                </p>
                <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Resource:</strong> Work with a cultural consultant or wedding planner who specializes in
                  Indian-American weddings. They can bridge the gap between generations and help you create meaningful
                  ceremonies.
                </p>

                <h4 className="font-serif text-xl text-charcoal mb-4">When Your Partner is Not Indian:</h4>
                <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  <strong>Strategy:</strong> Education is key. Create a wedding website with explanations of each
                  tradition. Have your partner's family participate in rituals where appropriate.
                </p>
                <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Inclusion:</strong> Incorporate traditions from your partner's culture as well. A true fusion
                  wedding honors both backgrounds equally.

                <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  There's no single "right way" to have an Indian-American fusion wedding. The most meaningful
                  celebrations are those that authentically reflect who you are as a couple—honoring your heritage while
                  embracing your modern identity.
                </p>
                <p className="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Whether you choose to include all the traditional ceremonies or select just a few meaningful rituals,
                  what matters most is that your wedding feels true to you. The traditions are there to enhance your
                  celebration, not constrain it.
